The "ArrayList" usage and removal of rain drops from the list
in the 'Sunshower' was inspired Daniel Shiffman's Particle
Systems lessons in "The Nature of Code." The lifespan logic found
in the 'Splash' class is also inspired from these lessons.

The basis of how to use PVectors and what they mean in terms
of processing code was inspired by Daniel Shiffman's Vector 
lessons in "The Nature of Code."
